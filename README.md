## 🚀 NEW IN V14.0: THE SINGULARITY
* **Absolute Centering:** Abandoned grid layouts for a **Vertical Pillar Architecture**. Everything is forced into a 420px "Safe Zone" in the dead center of the screen.
* **Interactive Neural Link:** Optimized `z-index` and `pointer-events`. Background stars no longer block mouse input; Pilot IDs and Frequency Selectors are 100% responsive.
* **Multi-Chrome Engine:** Instant CSS variable swapping. Change your frequency (Vapor, Disco, Techno) and the entire station's neon glow updates in real-time.
* **Gold Overdrive:** Upon reaching your mission goal, the system triggers:
    * **Golden Meteors:** All light streaks shift to gold.
    * **Victory Fireworks:** Centered particle explosions.
    * **HUD Evolution:** The UI borders and glow turn Elite Gold.

## 🕹️ PILOT CONTROLS
* **Select Frequency:** Updates the visual theme and audio stream.
* **Pilot ID:** Enter your callsign to engage systems.
* **Warp Slider:** Adjust the speed of the universe in real-time.
* **Abort Mission:** Resets the neural link to the login sector.
