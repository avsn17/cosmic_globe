# 🌌 COSMIC_GLOBE
**MU/TH/UR 6000 CERTIFIED FOCUS COCKPIT**

`cosmic_globe` is a dual-interface productivity engine designed for deep-work immersion. It combines a **CRT-aesthetic Web HUD** for visual focus and a **Mac/Linux Terminal CLI** for mission logging and orbital tracking.

---

## 📟 TERMINAL ENGINE (The CLI)
The heart of the system is the `warp` command, a Python-driven mission timer that logs focus sessions as "distance traveled" in the cosmos.

### Quick Start
- **`warp`**: Start a standard 25-minute mission.
- **`warp [mins]`**: Initiate a custom duration warp (e.g., `warp 45`).
- **`warp --stats`**: Access the flight log to see lifetime distance and mission history.

---

## 🌐 WEB HUD (The Interface)
A web-based terminal with a retro-future aesthetic, featuring:
- **CRT Scanline Effects**: Old-school monitor vibes.
- **Zone Glitch Overlay**: Visual feedback for deep work states.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Accessible via GitHub Pages on any device.

## 🛠️ INSTALLATION (BASH)
To install the `warp` command in your local environment:
