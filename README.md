# 🌌 COSMIC_GLOBE: NEURAL_HUD v5.0

> **"Hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength."** — *Uncle Iroh*

An autonomous, music-reactive focus environment built to bridge the gap between high-performance work and deep-space aesthetics. Fully automated, backed by Gemini-class logic.

## 🛰️ SYSTEM MODULES

### 1. Neural Load Engine (Audio-Reactive)
* **Frequency Analysis:** Real-time Web Audio API monitoring.
* **Color-Shift Calibration:** The Load Bar transitions from **Matrix Green** to **Solar Gold** to **Critical Red** based on sonic intensity.
* **Light-Streak Propulsion:** 3D-perspective meteors explode from the center of the screen, synced to bass frequency peaks (>195Hz).

### 2. Multi-Frequency Neural Link
Selectable audio streams curated for different cognitive states:
* **DREAMY (Vapor):** Hazy, ambient vibes (Cigarettes After Sex / Lana Del Rey).
* **70s GOLD (Disco):** High-rhythm momentum (Bee Gees).
* **DEEP TECHNO (Pulse):** Pure, aggressive focus for complex engineering tasks.

### 3. Tactical Command Panel
Real-time toggles allow the Pilot to modify the HUD without breaking the warp:
* **METEORS:** Enable/Disable high-speed visual streaks.
* **RED_ALERT_PULSE:** Toggle full-screen chromatic flashes for high-load music.
* **SCANLINES:** Toggle the CRT hardware filter.

### 4. Autonomous Mission Cycle
* **The Warp:** 25-minute automated focus sprints.
* **Refueling:** 5-minute cooldown period with a screen inversion milestone effect.
* **Persistence:** LocalStorage integration ensures your total Light Year (LY) distance is saved across sessions.
